## Hello! 

I am an enthusiastic and self motivated person who is seeking for new knowledge and have more experience. I am a person who have a great interest in the IT industry in Sri Lanka and in a global scale.

I studied at [Ananda College](https://www.facebook.com/anandacollege), for GCE Advanced Level and GCE Ordinary Level Examinations.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
